message: "Hello Don,  \r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to write a comment here.  \r\nFirst, I want to thank you for all you have done (and continue doing) for the PowerShell community, and specifically for the VERIFIED EFFECTIVE program.  \r\n\r\nMaybe it was difficult to administer, but you nailed it.  \r\nI think this was the best certification (or non-certification) exam I have ever taken. And I have taken quite a few, from quite a few vendors.  \r\n\r\nAt the time, we could take it online, we got a transcript showing the output and the help of a command and we had 6 hours to build that command. This was a really great way to measure real-world PowerShell skills.\r\nIn this format, I think it was very difficult to pass by just cheating, as long as long the pool of transcripts was large enough. To make this easier, slight variations on the same scenario is probably good enough to prevent brainless cheating.  \r\n\r\nThe fact that there was a human reviewer to grade the assignment made it very credible and valuable, but I imagine it made it very labour-intensive for you.  \r\n\r\nI don’t remember any calls for reviewers though, maybe I could have helped.  \r\n\r\nMost of us have more ideas and projects than time to realize them, so we all have to choose our battles.\r\nRegarding the quiz idea, I remember there was [this](http://powershell.org/wp/2015/01/06/lets-make-a-powershell-job-interview-quiz-cmon-and-help/).  \r\nHas this project ever come to fruition ?  \r\nI didn’t join at the time, because I couldn’t afford this time investment.\r\nBut now, I have a little bit of time that I’m willing to give back to the PowerShell community.  \r\n\r\nSo, if you (or someone else) need a bit of help for a similar project, there’s a chance I could help."
