message: "As the person who’s “abandoning” the effort, I want to point out that it was never presented as a “certification.” That word has a very specific legal meaning.  \r\n\r\nBut given the uptake (the number of people interested in it), the cost and effort, and a number of other very practical, logistical factors, it just isn’t feasible. You’re arguing that something like VERIFIED EFFECTIVE is necessary, and nobody is disagreeing. Many others have made the same point – but to date, nobody has stepped up to volunteer to run the program.  \r\n\r\nI think you’ve come up with a great set of interview questions, though, and maybe that’s what companies should be relying on? Or, would you be willing to publish your questions as a sort of quiz, where you graded people’s answers?  \r\n\r\nHow would you keep people from “cheating” once the questions were known ahead of time? All factors to consider – logistical factors, which are what make administering these programs difficult."
