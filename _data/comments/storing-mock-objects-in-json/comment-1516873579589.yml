  Thanks for the great article! Personally if I have a particularly complex
  object to Mock, i've been temporarily modifying the code so that when it runs
  it exports that object to a file via `Export-Clixml` (then I've been editing
  the file to anonymize the data) and storing it in the Tests folder named
  `<callingfunction><cmdletname>.mock.xml`. Then obviously I just load the
  object for the mock with `Import-Clixml`. It does result however in the Tests
  folder becoming quite cluttered with XMLs, so I do like how your method puts
  them all together in a single file.
