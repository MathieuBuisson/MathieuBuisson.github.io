  Hi. I really liked this too! Although found out that the script needs to be
  run As Admin to get the Ticks and thus CPU% values (otherwise runs into zero
  divisions errors). Also, the State = Wait and User CPU% = 100 seems funny
  (shown in your screenshot and noticed the same on my server). But anyway, this
  was a good learning for me. Thanks!
