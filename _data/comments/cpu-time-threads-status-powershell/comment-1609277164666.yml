message: "The coronavirus pandemic has unnatural universities to lash to interval learning. essay on service to humanity is service to god <a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>perfect thesis statement</a> what is a good essay writing service. \r\nBut what is happening now can be named an emergency delivery of content to audience members in isolation . Many schools  and the teachers themselves were not ready for the move to online. According to a 2019 HSE study, University teachers with an academic degree rate their level of proficiency in remote technologies at 3.2 points out of five. One in four people has never utilized remote video services to take part in webinars or video conferences in the past three years. \r\nBut professors are not required to own online studying technologies. They were simply not ready for this, although education and its advanced methods are the main function of academies. Try to oblige the surgeon to do their work in self-isolation. Let him explain to the patient via Skype how to remove his appendicitis. It sounds strange. Therefore, the resourcefulness with which educators adapt to the remote format is commendable. \r\n \r\nSome of the time it gets funny. Colleagues from regional universities told that some teachers asked to write lectures by hand and send them scans for according.Nowadays, people communicate remotely in real time thanks to new digital technologies, students can \"raise their hands\" with one button, they can write with a finger on a tablet as on a blackboard, and they are told: \"Please write a handwritten conspectus and send the scan.\" Or, for example, this case: a physical education teacher asked students to shoot five-minute videos where they make physical exercises. Although remote physical excercises can be more originative, for example, you can make a selection of ready-made videos on YouTube, find checklists in the official domain, and teach them to play sports at home, while you can't go anywhere anywhere. \r\n \r\nUniversity professors are faced with a lack of guidance and difficulties in dealing with organizational matters. Someone conduct lessons on Skype, some of them -in Zoom, someone only sends tasks to WhatsApp. Some educators record lectures on a webcam and send them to students. The quality of such materials is minimal, and it is quite difficult  to perceive them. At least because the videos on YouTube, which students are used to, is shot and edited professionally and the viewer is spoiled by the quality of video materials. \r\nThere are also difficulties with monitoring attendance. Some teachers ask you to put a \" + \" in the chat, others ask  you to turn on Webcams and take screenshots of students. Against the background of all the misunderstandings and troubles, one element of academic life remains unchanged - assessment. Students don't study on campus, but they will get grades, even formal ones. \r\n<a href=http://goodthesisstatementsdsa.com/>write my thesis</a> \r\nLearning online from home does not have these disadvantages, because it is based on a carefully designed learning process in an electronic information and educational environment. Professors have instructions, manuals, memos,checklists, templates for emails and notifications, and even presentations. Everything is thought out here-from the screen saver before the lesson to the slide with homework."
