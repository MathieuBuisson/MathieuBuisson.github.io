By extending its free trial subscription of CrowdVoice to up to 90 days per customer, RingLeader aims to help travelers, immigrants and expats who need a reliable, secure and affordable means to keep in regular touch with friends, family and colleagues wherever they may be in North America. \r\n \r\nThe novel coronavirus and subsequent social distancing measures and global travel restrictions are resulting in a massive spike in internet and phone usage. To help families, small businesses and organizations during this challenging time, RingLeader is providing 25,000 months of free CrowdVoice service. As part of the special COVID-19 promotional offering, RingLeader will provide each user free messaging and VoIP services including unlimited inbound international calling and 500 minutes of free outbound calling per month where service is available. New customers will also receive a U.S. phone number and an international phone number in Canada or Mexico, ensuring high quality calls between the CrowdVoice app and landlines. \r\n \r\n“COVID-19 is severely impacting families around the world as well as small businesses with an international presence,” says Neil Darling, CEO, RingLeader. “By donating 25,000 months of service, we’re able to help families across borders stay connected both where they are – and where they want to be. Additionally, we are confident that the CrowdVoice app improves on the shortcomings of other leading mobile communication apps like WhatsApp, most notably by providing a selection of inbound North American telephone numbers for each user. CrowdVoice isn’t WhatsApp; we believe it’s ‘WhatsBetter’.” \r\n \r\nThe CrowdVoice mobile app brings unified communications, social messaging and end-to-end encryption all under one umbrella. With key features such as text, chat, SMS & picture and video file sharing, staying in touch with friends and family has never been easier. Additional features such as custom caller ID, fax-to-email, voicemail-to-email and group chat enable small business owners to run their businesses more effectively while reducing costs. \r\n \r\nTo learn more about RingLeader’s COVID-19 promotional offering, or to download the CrowdVoice app, visit https://ringleader.co/crowdvoice/. \r\n \r\nAbout RingLeader \r\nRingLeader is a leading internet phone service provider for businesses of all sizes across North America.
