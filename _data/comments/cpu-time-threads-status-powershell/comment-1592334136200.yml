  Great stuff. Helped me a lot because i needed to me migrate from 'Win10' back
  to 7, from XP... Many of applications where kept hidden in memory waiting to
  be triggered again. The specified application cannot be accessed from my
  'Win7' OS again. Leaving an error in my log, letting my system recognize
  current application construction. After running the function and marking the
  ID of my 'SearchIndexer' some things were on state 'ready'.
