  Your advocacy for Powershell over Bash is incredibly laughable. First of all,
  the use of text versus objects is infinitely more extensible and flexible.
  Objects are bloat, when you can easily just make an object yourself. It's
  bloat. Second, the verbosity of the powershell "cmdlets" are ridiculous. You
  have to type a paragraph just to do something simple like list things in a
  directory. How inefficient. Let's not forget how slow things are in PowerShell
  versus Bash. Because you're literally dealing with a higher level of
  abstraction by using objects and "cmdlets" rather than just text input and
  output. Microsoft and windows have been a plague on the tech industry. Their
  products are 100% garbage and they do not care about privacy, speed,
  efficiency. Their windows 10 is spyware, adware, and malware, pretending to be
  an operating system.
