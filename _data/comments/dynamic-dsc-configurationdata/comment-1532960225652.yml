message: "Hi ekw,  \r\nLike you, I was recently looking for `Export-PowershellDataFile` to write data from a script to a file, and then, re-hydrate this data from the file to another script.  \r\n\r\nBut `Export-PowershellDataFile` does not exist, which is, in my opinion, a unfortunate omission.  \r\n\r\nIn this specific case,  I failed back to using **JSON** instead of a native **PowerShell** data file, to store and re-hydrate data."
