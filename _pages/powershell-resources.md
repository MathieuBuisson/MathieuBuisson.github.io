## Video trainings  

#### [Getting Started with PowerShell 3.0 Jump Start](https://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/en-us/training-courses/getting-started-with-powershell-30-jump-start-8276) :  
A training course provided by the <abbr title="Microsoft Virtual Academy">MVA</abbr>.  
It is an amazing and fun introduction to PowerShell, filled with eye-opening tips and tricks from **Jeffrey Snover**, the "inventor" of PowerShell.  

#### [Advanced Tools & Scripting with PowerShell 3.0 Jump Start](https://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/en-us/training-courses/advanced-tools-scripting-with-powershell-30-jump-start-8277) :  
The follow-up to the "Getting started" course but it goes into scripting and building flexible and reusable tools with PowerShell. Again, **Jeffrey Snover** provides invaluable behind-the-scenes insights.  

#### [Getting Started with PowerShell Desired State Configuration (DSC)](https://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/en-us/training-courses/getting-started-with-powershell-desired-state-configuration-dsc-8672) :  
Configuration management based on the principle of **infrastructure-as-code** has become very important in IT pros toolbelt. In this regard, DSC has been a crucial addition to PowerShell.  
Once again, this is a free MVA course delivered by the enthusiastic **Jason Helmick** and **Jeffrey Snover**. It is pretty easy to understand and fun. Again, the participation of the "inventor" of PowerShell allows us to learn the "What" but also the "Why" of many PowerShell DSC features and components.  

#### [Windows PowerShell v2-v3-v4 Ultimate Training](https://www.cbtnuggets.com/it-training/microsoft-windows-powershell-2-3-4) :  
The most complete video training you can find on PowerShell, it contains dozens of hours of material. Delivered by **Don Jones**, long-time PowerShell guru and a really, really, great teacher.  
What is really nice in this training is that topic by topic, it provides the differences and the new features introduced by different PowerShell versions.  

## Books  

#### [Learn Windows PowerShell 3 in a Month of Lunches](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Windows-PowerShell-Month-Lunches/dp/1617291080) :  
Don't worry about PowerShell version 3.0 being quite old. The fundamental principles are the same in PowerShell 5.0 and even 6.0.  
This book by **Don Jones** takes your PowerShell knowledge from zero to proficient in all the fundamental concepts (and even some of the internals).  
Even if you are already familiar with PowerShell, you will learn some things from this book.  

#### [Learn PowerShell Toolmaking in a Month of Lunches](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-PowerShell-Toolmaking-Month-Lunches/dp/1617291161) :  
Same format and same great author as the book just above.  
It is more advanced because it goes into not just scripting but building flexible, highly reusable tools which behave like native PowerShell cmdlets. This book teaches widely recognized PowerShell best practices and will make you realize its elegance and its power.  

## Blogs/Sites

#### [PowerShell.org](https://powershell.org/) :  
Community-focused site with "how-to" articles and great to keep up with the PowerShell-related news and events.  
Also, their forum is friendly to beginners and advanced users alike.  

#### [Mike F Robbins](http://mikefrobbins.com/) :  
A long-time <del>PowerShell</del> <ins>Cloud & Datacenter Management</ins> MVP and author.  
He regularly provides very practical tips and knowledge on PowerShell, mostly applicable to systems administration.  

#### [Kevin Marquette on PowerShell Theory](https://kevinmarquette.github.io/) :  
Surprisingly, he is not an MVP (yet) but I think it's only a matter of time.  
Most of his posts are pretty advanced, deep and amazingly detailed. Some of this material is trailblazing (kudos for that) and DevOps oriented.  

## Conferences  

#### PowerShell + DevOps Global Summit :  
Comparatively to most conferences, it is small. This is a good thing because the attendees tend to be very passionate and it facilitates discussion with attendees and speakers.  
Also, you get to talk to some of people who are actually building and maintaining the product.  
Here are the [session recordings from the 2017 edition](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfeA8kIs7CoeQRT1xwtH-I3cfDvm8rNlk).  

#### PowerShell Conference EU :  
The speaker list and the sessions are of very high quality. Some of these sessions are pretty advanced and forward-thinking.  
Have a look at the [session recordings from the 2017 edition](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDCEho7foSooHYGxYqUj2Q6C7usp4aKIQ).
