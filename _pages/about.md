## About TheShellNut  
 
I spend a lot of time in shells (mostly [PowerShell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell)) and IDEs (mostly [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)).  
I like experimenting, <del>breaking</del> <ins>automating</ins> things, building tools to deepen or expand my knowledge and skills.  

The main purpose of this blog is to document the results of my experimentations.  
Documenting this in the form of blog posts allows me to retrieve and share this information easily.  

## About Mathieu Buisson   

I’m `((Get-Date) - [DateTime]"03/07/1982").Days / 365` years old and I live in Ireland since 2008.

### What fuels me :  
  - Lots of coffee (this might be the only area of my life where quantity matters more than quality)
