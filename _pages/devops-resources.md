#### [DevOps Library](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOnioSzUZS-ZqsRnf38V2nA/playlists) :  
This YouTube channel has a whole bunch of DevOps-related tutorials, most of which are intended for beginners.  
I liked [their Jenkins series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6TwUbrFsOuN-db811WkXF1hwGTexiiOH) when I was getting started and I highly recommend it if you are considering a Jenkins certification.  

#### [bundyfx](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKZy6c6KewxX_SnfYpOMxLg/feed) :  
Flynn Bundy introduces many DevOps-related concepts in short, practical videos.  
This is primarily on bleeding-edge topics and technologies.  

#### [Stop Hiring DevOps Experts and Start Growing Them by Jez Humble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6m9nCtyn6kE) :  
This talk recording is not just about hiring and/or managing employees, it is actually a nice summary of what DevOps is all about (or what it <em>should be</em> all about).  
There are plenty of amazing talks from **Jez Humble** on YouTube, but I recently watched this one and particularly liked it.
